Mind

Sittin' all alone
Mouth full of gum
In the driveway
My friends aren't far
In the back of my car
Lay their bodies

Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?

They'll be here pretty soon
Lookin' through my room 
For the money
I'm bitin' my nails
I'm too young to go to jail
It's kinda funny

Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?

Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache

Everything I do 
The way I wear my noose
Like a necklace
I wanna make 'em scared 
Like I could be anywhere
Like I'm reckless

I lost my mind
I don't mind
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?

Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache

NDA

Did you think I'd show up in a limousine? No
Had to save my money for security
Got a stalker walkin' up and down the street
Says he's Satan and he'd like to meet

I bought a secret house when I was seventeen
Haven't had a party since I got the keys
Had a pretty boy over but he couldn't stay
On his way out, made him sign an NDA

Yeah, I made him sign an NDA
Once was good enough
'Cause I don't want him having shit to say
Oh-oh-oh

You couldn't save me but you can't let me go
I can crave you but you don't need to know

Oh, oh-oh-oh

Thirty under thirty for another year
I can barely go outside, I think I hate it here
Maybe I should think about a new career
Somewhere in Kauai where I can disappear

I've been having fun getting older now
Didn't change my number, made him shut his mouth
At least I gave him something he can cry about
I thought about my future but I want it now
Oh-oh-oh
Want it now
Oh-oh-oh
(You can't give me up)

You couldn't save me but you can't let me go
I can crave you but you don't need to know

Did I take it too far?
Now I know what you are
You hit me so hard
I saw stars
Think I took it too far
When I sold you my heart
How'd it get so dark?
I saw stars
Stars

Therefore I Am

I'm not your friend or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am

Stop, what the hell are you talking about? Ha
Get my pretty name outta your mouth
We are not the same with or without
Don't talk 'bout me like how you might know how I feel
Top of the world, but your world isn't real
Your world's an ideal

So go have fun
I really couldn't care less
And you can give 'em my best, but just know

I'm not your friend or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am

I don't want press to put your name next to mine
We're on different lines, so I
Wanna be nice enough, they don't call my bluff
'Cause I hate to find
Articles, articles, articles
Rather you remain unremarkable
Got a lotta interviews, interviews, interviews
When they say your name, I just act confused

Did you have fun?
I really couldn't care less
And you can give 'em my best, but just know

I'm not your friend or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am

I'm sorry
I don't think I caught your name
I'm sorry
I don't think I caught your name

I'm not your friend or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend or anything, damn
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am

My Lucifer is lonely

Standing there, killing time
Can't commit to anything but a crime
Peter's on vacation, an open invitation
Animals, evidence
Pearly gates look more like a picket fence
Once you get inside 'em
Got friends but can't invite them

Hills burn in California
My turn to ignore ya
Don't say I didn't warn ya

All the good girls go to hell
'Cause even God herself has enemies
And once the water starts to rise
And heaven's out of sight
She'll want the devil on her team

My Lucifer is lonely

Look at you needing me
You know I'm not your friend without some greenery
Walk in wearing fetters
Peter should know better
Your cover up is caving in
Man is such a fool
Why are we saving him?
Poisoning themselves now
Begging for our help, wow!

Hills burn in California

when the party's over

Don't you know I'm no good for you?
I've learned to lose you, can't afford to
Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'
But nothin' ever stops you leavin'

Quiet when I'm comin' home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

Don't you know too much already?
I'll only hurt you if you let me
Call me friend but keep me closer (call me back)
And I'll call you when the party's over

Quiet when I'm comin' home and I'm on my own
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Yeah, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

But nothin' is better sometimes
Once we've both said our goodbyes
Let's just let it go
Let me let you go

Quiet when I'm comin' home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

listen before i go

Take me to the rooftop
I wanna see the world when I stop breathing, turnin' blue (blue)
Tell me love is endless, don't be so pretentious
Leave me like you do (like you do)

If you need me, wanna see me
Better hurry 'cause I'm leavin' soon

Sorry can't save me now
Sorry I don't know how
Sorry there's no way out (sorry)
But down
Mm, down

Taste me, the salty tears on my cheek
That's what a year long headache does to you
I'm not okay, I feel so scattered
Don't say I'm all that matters
Leave me, deja vu (mm)

If you need me, wanna see me
You better hurry, I'm leavin' soon

Sorry can't save me now (sorry)
Sorry I don't know how (sorry)
Sorry there's no way out (sorry)
But down
Mm, down

Call my friends and tell them that I love them
And I'll miss them
But I'm not sorry
Call my friends and tell them that I love them
And I'll miss them
Sorry

Bad Guy

White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleeping, you're on your tippy toes
Creeping around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal

Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please, I do
What I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical

So you're a tough guy
Like-it-really-rough guy
Just-can't-get-enough guy
Chest-always-so-puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make-your-mama-sad type
Make-your-girlfriend-mad type
Might-seduce-your-dad type
I'm the bad guy, duh

I'm the bad guy

I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal

My mommy likes to sing along
With me but she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know

So you're a tough guy
Like-it-really-rough guy
Just-can't-get-enough guy
Chest-always-so-puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make-your-mama-sad type
Make-your-girlfriend-mad type
Might-seduce-your-dad type
I'm the bad guy, duh

I'm the bad guy, duh

I'm only good at being bad
Bad

I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad
That you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean
I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne

I'm a bad guy
I'm, I'm a bad guy
Bad guy, bad guy
I'm a bad guy



bury a friend

What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

Come here
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly
You're payin'? Is the amount cleanin' you out, am I satisfactory?
Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly
The way I'm drinkin' you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me

Step on the glass, staple your tongue (ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (ah-ahh)
Cannibal class, killing the son (ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna

What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

Listen
Keep you in the dark, what had you expected?
Me to make you my art and make you a star
And get you connected?
I'll meet you in the park, I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart
'Cause I'm too expensive
It's probably somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now (wow)
Calling security, keepin' my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury your friend right now

The debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no
Then my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close
And I can't say no, I can't say no
Careful

Step on the glass, staple your tongue (ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (ah-ahh)
Cannibal class, killing the son (ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna

What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

my future

I can't seem to focus
And you don't seem to notice
I'm not here
I'm just a mirror
You check your complexion
To find your reflection's all alone
I had to go

Can't you hear me?
I'm not comin' home
Do you understand?
I've changed my plans

'Cause I, I'm in love
With my future
Can't wait to meet her
And I, I'm in love
But not with anybody else
Just wanna get to know myself

I know supposedly I'm lonely now (lonely now)
Know I'm supposed to be unhappy
Without someone (someone)
But aren't I someone? (Aren't I someone? Yeah)
I'd (I'd) like to be your answer (be your answer)
'Cause you're so handsome (you're so handsome)

But I know better
Than to drive you home
'Cause you'd invite me in
And I'd be yours again

But I, I'm in love (love, love, love, love)
With my future
And you don't know her
And I, I'm in love (love, love)
But not with anybody here
I'll see you in a couple years

COPYCAT

Don't be cautious, don't be kind
You committed, I'm your crime
Push my button anytime
You got your finger on the trigger, but your trigger finger's mine

Silver dollar, golden flame
Dirty water, poison rain
Perfect murder, take your aim
I don't belong to anyone, but everybody knows my name

By the way
You've been uninvited
'Cause all you say
Are all the same things I did

Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamour
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine

Call me calloused, call me cold
You're italic, I'm in bold
Call me cocky, watch your tone
You better love me 'cause you're just a clone

By the way (by the way)
You've been uninvited
'Cause all you say (all you say)
Are all the same things I did

Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamour
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine

Mine
I would hate to see you go
Hate to be the one that told you so
You just crossed the line
You've run out of time
I'm so sorry, now you know
Sorry I'm the one that told you so
Sorry, sorry
I'm sorry, sorry
Psych

By the way
You've been uninvited
'Cause all you say
Are all the same things I did

Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamour
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine

you should see me in a crown

Bite my tongue, bide my time
Wearing a warning sign
Wait 'til the world is mine
Visions I vandalize
Cold in my kingdom size
Fell for these ocean eyes

You should see me in a crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by
You should see me in a crown
Your silence is my favorite sound
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by one

Count my cards, watch them fall
Blood on a marble wall
I like the way they all
Scream
Tell me which one is worse
Living or dying first
Sleeping inside a hearse
I don't dream

You say
Come over baby
I think you're pretty
I'm okay
I'm not your baby
If you think I'm pretty

You should see me in a crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by 
You should see me in a crown
Your silence is my favorite sound
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by one

Crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by
You should see me in a crown (you should see me, see me)
Your silence is my favorite sound (you should see me, see me)
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by one

idontwannabeyouanymore

Don't be that way
Fall apart twice a day
I just wish you could feel what you say
Show, never tell
But I know you too well
Got a mood that you wish you could sell

If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told "a tight dress is what makes you a whore"
If "I love you" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
I don't wanna be you, anymore

Hand, hands getting cold
Losing feeling is getting old
Was I made from a broken mold?
Hurt, I can't shake
We've made every mistake
Only you know the way that I break

If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told "a tight dress is what makes you a whore"
If "I love you" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
I-I don't wanna be you
I don't wanna be you
I don't wanna be you, anymore

Your Power

Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But having it's so strange

She said you were a hero, you played the part
But you ruined her in a year, don't act like it was hard
And you swear you didn't know (didn't know)
No wonder why you didn't ask
She was sleeping in your clothes (in your clothes)
But now she's got to get to class

How dare you?
And how could you?
Will you only feel bad when they find out?
If you could take it all back, would you?

Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But having it's so strange

I thought that I was special, you made me feel
Like it was my fault you were the devil, lost your appeal
Does it keep you in control? (In control)
For you to keep her in a cage?
And you swear you didn't know (didn't know)
You said you thought she was your age

How dare you?
And how could you?
Will you only feel bad if it turns out 
That they kill your contract?
Would you?

Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But power isn't pain

Mmm
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, hmm

ilomilo

Told you not to worry
But maybe that's a lie
Honey, what's your hurry?
Won't you stay inside?
Remember not to get too close to stars
They're never gonna give you love like ours

Where did you go?
I should know, but it's cold
And I don't wanna be lonely
So show me the way home
I can't lose another life

Hurry, I'm worried

The world's a little blurry
Or maybe it's my eyes
The friends I've had to bury
They keep me up at night
Said I couldn't love someone
'Cause I might break
If you're gonna die, not by mistake

So, where did you go?
I should know, but it's cold
And I don't wanna be lonely
So tell me you'll come home
Even if it's just a lie

I tried not to upset you
Let you rescue me the day I met you
I just wanted to protect you
But now I'll never get to

Hurry, I'm worried

Where did you go?
I should know, but it's cold
And I don't wanna be lonely
Was hoping you'd come home
I don't care if it's a lie

ocean eyes

I've been watchin' you for some time
Can't stop starin' at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes

No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you gimme those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

I've been walkin' through a world gone blind
Can't stop thinkin' of your diamond mind
Careful creature made friends with time
He left her lonely with a diamond mind
And those ocean eyes

No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you gimme those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

Da, da-da, da-da
Da-da-da, da, da
Da, da, da, da, da-da-da-da
Mm
Mm
Mm

No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you gimme those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Fallin' into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes

No Time To Die

I should've known
I'd leave alone
Just goes to show
That the blood you bleed 
Is just the blood you owe

We were a pair
But I saw you there
Too much to bear
You were my life
But life is far away from fair

Was I stupid to love you?
Was I reckless to help?
Was it obvious to everybody else

That I'd fallen for a lie?
You were never on my side
Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death or paradise?
Now you'll never see me cry
There's just no time to die

I let it burn
You're no longer my concern
Faces from my past return
Another lesson yet to learn

That I'd fallen for a lie
You were never on my side
Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death or paradise?
Now you'll never see me cry
There's just no time to die

No time to die
No time to die

Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death or paradise?
Now you'll never see me cry

There's just no time to die

Lost Cause

Something's in the

Something's in the air right now
Like I'm losin' track of time (time, time)
Like I don't really care right now
But maybe that's fine
You weren't even there that day
I was waitin' on you (you, you)
I wondered if you were aware that day
Was the last straw for me and I knew (knew)

I sent you flowers
Did you even care?
You ran the shower
And left them by the stairs
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ayy-ayy-ayy-ayy
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Thought you had your shit together

But damn, I was wrong (wrong)
You ain't nothin' but a lost cause (cause)
And this ain't nothin' like it once was (was)
I know you think you're such an outlaw, yeah
But you got no job (job)
You ain't nothin' but a lost cause (cause)
And this ain't nothin' like it once was (was)
I know you think you're such an outlaw
But you got no job

I used to think you were shy (shy)
But maybe you just had nothin' on your mind
Maybe you were thinkin' 'bout yourself all the time
I used to wish you were mine (mine)
But that was way before I realized
Someone like you would always be so easy to find

(So) so easy (easy)
(So mm-mm) easy, mm-mm-mm, mm

Gave me no flowers
Wish I didn't care
You'd be gone for hours
Could be anywhere
Ooh
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Thought you would've grown eventually

But you proved me wrong (wrong)
You ain't nothin' but a lost cause (cause)
And this ain't nothin' like it once was (was)
I know you think you're such an outlaw (yeah)
But you got no job (no job)
You ain't nothin' but a lost cause (cause)
And this ain't nothin' like it once was (was)
I know you think you're such an outlaw (think you're such a lost cause)
But you got no job

What did I tell you?
Don't get complacent
It's time to face it now, now, now, now, now, now
What did I tell you?
Don't get complacent
It's time to face it now, now, now, now

wish you were gay

Baby, I don't feel so good
Six words you never understood
I'll never let you go
Five words you'll never say (aw)
I laugh along like nothing's wrong
Four days has never felt so long
If three's a crowd and two was us
One slipped away

I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way, mm
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay

Is there a reason we're not through?
Is there a twelve step just for you?
Our conversation's all in blue
Eleven, "Heys" (hey, hey, hey, hey)
Ten fingers tearin' out my hair
Nine times you never made it there
I ate alone at seven, you were six minutes away (yay)

How am I supposed to make you feel okay
When all you do is walk the other way? Uh
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay, uh
I just kinda wish you were gay

To spare my pride
To give your lack of interest an explanation
Don't say I'm not your type
Just say that I'm not your preferred sexual orientation
I'm so selfish
But you make me feel helpless, yeah
And I can't stand another day
Stand another day

I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way, mm
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay, uh
I just kinda wish you were gay
I just kinda wish you were gay
I just kinda wish you were gay

i love you

It's not true
Tell me I've been lied to
Cryin' isn't like you
Ooh
What the hell did I do?
Never been the type to
Let someone see right through
Ooh

Maybe won't you take it back?
Say you were tryna make me laugh
And nothin' has to change today
You didn't mean to say, "I love you"
I love you and I don't want to
Ooh

Up all night on another red eye
I wish we never learned to fly
I
Maybe we should just try
To tell ourselves a good lie
I didn't mean to make you cry
I

Maybe won't you take it back?
Say you were tryna make me laugh
And nothin' has to change today
You didn't mean to say, "I love you"
I love you and I don't want to
Ooh

The smile that you gave me
Even when you felt like dyin'

We fall apart as it gets dark
I'm in your arms in Central Park
There's nothin' you could do or say
I can't escape the way I love you
I don't want to, but I love you
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

everything i wanted

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm being honest

It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly (fly)
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried (cried, cried, cried, cried)
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care (might care, might care)

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

And you say, "As long as I'm here
No one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here
But you can learn to
If I could change
The way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
They don't deserve you"

I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter

Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

And you say, "As long as I'm here
No one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here
But you can learn to
If I could change
The way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
They don't deserve you"

If I knew it all then would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?
If I knew it all then would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
