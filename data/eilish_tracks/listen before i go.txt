listen before i go

Take me to the rooftop
I wanna see the world when I stop breathing, turnin' blue (blue)
Tell me love is endless, don't be so pretentious
Leave me like you do (like you do)

If you need me, wanna see me
Better hurry 'cause I'm leavin' soon

Sorry can't save me now
Sorry I don't know how
Sorry there's no way out (sorry)
But down
Mm, down

Taste me, the salty tears on my cheek
That's what a year long headache does to you
I'm not okay, I feel so scattered
Don't say I'm all that matters
Leave me, deja vu (mm)

If you need me, wanna see me
You better hurry, I'm leavin' soon

Sorry can't save me now (sorry)
Sorry I don't know how (sorry)
Sorry there's no way out (sorry)
But down
Mm, down

Call my friends and tell them that I love them
And I'll miss them
But I'm not sorry
Call my friends and tell them that I love them
And I'll miss them
Sorry
